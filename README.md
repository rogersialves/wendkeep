**A persistent‑memory harness for AI coding agents, built on your Obsidian vault.** Every Claude Code / Codex session is captured turn‑by‑turn into local Markdown — with token/cost tracking, auto‑extracted decisions, bugs and learnings, and a curated memory layer injected back at the start of the next session. On top of that memory core sits a native, zero‑dependency **change lifecycle** (spec → change → TDD → sensor‑gated archive) that keeps intent, work and proof wikilinked in one graph. 100% local, open‑core.

```bash
npm i -D wendkeep && npx wendkeep init      # captures from the next session on
npx wendkeep import                          # backfill past Claude + Codex sessions
```

## Why

The pieces to give a coding agent durable memory exist, but fragmented (qmd‑sessions, memsearch, Nexus, hand‑written hooks). wendkeep ships them as one turnkey package that lands the memory **inside the Obsidian graph you already use** — no manual setup, no snapshot to keep in sync.

## What you get

- **Automatic session capture** — `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` hooks write each session to `02-Sessões/<year>/<month>/DIA <dd>/` as Markdown with YAML frontmatter, turn‑by‑turn iterations, and wikilinks.
- **Multi‑agent** — detects the real provider (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot) at runtime; one install covers all.
- **Token & cost tracking** — per‑model, cache‑aware pricing (`pricing.json`) with a per‑session usage table.
- **Auto‑extracted derived notes** — decisions (ADR‑style), bugs and learnings pulled from the transcript into `04-Decisões/`, `05-Bugs/`, `06-Aprendizados/`, backlinked to the session.
- **Curated memory** — a cold frontmatter index (`.brain/`) plus a budget‑capped `CORE` + `DIGEST` injected at the next `SessionStart`.
- **Local‑first** — everything is plain Markdown on your disk. The optional MCP server (`@bitbonsai/mcpvault`) lets the agent read/write the vault; no cloud, no account.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- An AI coding agent with hooks (Claude Code today; Codex supported by the same hooks)
- Obsidian (to view the graph) — optional but the point

## Install & set up

```bash
# in your project
npm install --save-dev wendkeep   # or: npm install -g wendkeep
npx wendkeep init
```

`wendkeep init` is interactive and **idempotent**. It will:

1. Create the vault folder taxonomy and a templated `README.md` (default vault: `<project>/.<project-name>-vault`, e.g. `.MyApp-vault`; override with `--vault`).
2. **Merge** the three session hooks and `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` into `.claude/settings.json` — without clobbering your existing settings (a `.bak` is saved; an unparseable file is left untouched and a `.new` is written for you to merge).
3. Add the **`wendkeep-vault`** MCP server to `.mcp.json` so the agent can read/write the vault. Skip with `--no-mcp` — e.g. when the agent already has a vault MCP. (`--no-mcp` skips *only wendkeep's own* MCP; companion MCPs still follow `--companions`.)
4. Offer to pin **companion** plugins/MCP (multi-choice; only `context-mode` pre-checked). Each is wired the most agent-agnostic way it supports:
   - **`context-mode`** — context optimizer + FTS5 memory, as a `.mcp.json` MCP server (any agent). The recommended default.
   - **`understand-anything`** — project domain graph, via a `understand-inject` SessionStart hook that injects the graph when generated.
   - **`caveman`** — token-compression mode; runs its own cross-agent installer on non-Claude agents.
   - **`dotcontext`** — *legacy, not recommended.* wendkeep's native a2 loop (`change` / `verify` / gate) already does its job, so installing it **duplicates the harness**. Still selectable via `--companions dotcontext` for anyone already invested (tune with `--dotcontext-mcp` / `--dotcontext-hooks`), but off by default.

   Control with `--companions <csv>` or `--no-companions`. The Claude Code plugin layer (`extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins`) is wired as a bonus where the companion has one.
5. Install a **color system** into the vault's `.obsidian/`: a CSS snippet that accents notes by type (session/decision/bug/learning, via the `cssclasses` the hooks emit) plus graph color groups by folder. Non-destructive merge into `appearance.json`/`graph.json`; skip with `--no-colors`.
6. Seed the **curated memory layer**: `.brain/CORE.md` (the hand-curated hot layer, with the 3 required sections) and `.brain/COMPACTION_PROTOCOL.md` (the protocol guide). The auto layers (`DIGEST.md`, `index.jsonl`) are generated by the hooks. Validate the curated layer with `wendkeep validate-memory` (cap 25 lines, 3 sections, no secrets/PII).
7. Seed the **definitions + skills layer**: `.brain/agents/` + `.brain/skills/` (versioned source of truth), including the native process skills `wk-workflow` / `wk-tdd` / `wk-debugging` / `wk-brainstorming` / `wk-planning` / `wk-verify` (some ship bundled templates, e.g. `wk-verify`'s `verdict-template.json` + reviewer prompt). `init` runs `wendkeep sync-defs` for you, delivering them to `.codex/agents/` + `.claude/skills/` (re‑run `sync-defs` after editing `.brain`).
8. Seed the **change/spec lifecycle**: the `07-Specs/` + `08-Mudanças/` folders and a native `wendkeep.sensors.json` (a `validate-memory` sensor plus one per detected `package.json` script). Drives `wendkeep change` / `wendkeep verify` — see **Change lifecycle** below.

```bash
npx wendkeep init --vault "~/vaults/work" --project . --yes   # non-interactive (default companion: context-mode)
npx wendkeep init --companions "context-mode,understand-anything" --yes
npx wendkeep init --no-companions --no-mcp --yes              # zero companions, no wendkeep MCP
```

### `init` options

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--vault <path>` | Vault folder. Default `<project>/.<project-name>-vault`; interactive init asks. Point it at an existing vault to install into it. |
| `--project <path>` | Project root to wire (default: current directory). |
| `--locale <pt-BR\|en>` | Vault language — folder names, scaffold, skills. Interactive init asks; locked at init. |
| `--companions <csv>` | Companions to pin: `context-mode,caveman,understand-anything` (default: **none** — opt in explicitly; `dotcontext` is legacy). |
| `--no-companions` | Pin no companions. |
| `--no-mcp` | Skip **wendkeep's own** vault MCP (`wendkeep-vault`). Companion MCPs still follow `--companions`. |
| `--no-colors` | Skip the Obsidian color system (`.obsidian` snippet + graph groups). |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Non-interactive; accept defaults (skips the language / vault / companion prompts). |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing wendkeep config blocks. |

Then open the vault in Obsidian, send a test prompt in your agent, and confirm a note appears under `02-Sessões/…` (or `02-Sessions/…` for an `en` vault).

## Updating

Because the hooks live inside the installed package (settings.json calls `npx wendkeep hook <name>`), upgrading is just:

```bash
npm update wendkeep
```

No re‑copying, no snapshot to re‑sync — the package is the single source of truth.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wendkeep init` | Set up wendkeep in a project (vault taxonomy + settings + MCP + skills). |
| `wendkeep hook <name>` | Run a session hook; invoked by `settings.json` (reads agent JSON on stdin). |
| `wendkeep change <sub>` | Change lifecycle: `new [--simple]` / `list` / `show` / `status` / `done <id>` / `undone <id>` / `diff` / `archive [--force]`. |
| `wendkeep verify [--deep]` | Run the change's task sensors; `--deep` assembles the independent-verification package. |
| `wendkeep spec <sub>` | Living specs: `list` / `show <capability>`. |
| `wendkeep sensors <sub>` | `list` / `add <id> "<command>"` — view/edit `wendkeep.sensors.json` (JSON Schema shipped). |
| `wendkeep cost [--since d]` | Aggregate AI-coding spend across the vault's sessions — total, by model, by day (`--json`). |
| `wendkeep import [opts]` | **Retroactive memory** — backfill past **Claude + Codex** sessions into the vault (deduped by `session_id`). `--source all\|claude\|codex` / `--from <dir>` / `--codex-from <dir>` / `--since d` / `--limit n` / `--dry-run` / `--json`. |
| `wendkeep lesson add "t" "l"` | Record a project-local lesson (injected at the next SessionStart). |
| `wendkeep sync-defs` | Copy `.brain/agents\|skills` into the project (`.codex/agents`, `.claude/skills`). |
| `wendkeep validate-memory [path]` | Validate `.brain/CORE.md` (cap 25, 3 sections, no secrets/PII). |
| `wendkeep doctor [--vault P]` | Run a vault health check (integrity of sessions, registry, links). |
| `wendkeep --version` / `--help` | Version / usage. |

## Retroactive memory (`import`)

Install wendkeep into an existing project and it only remembers sessions **from now on**. `wendkeep import` fixes that: it reads the project's past **Claude Code and Codex** transcripts and rebuilds each one as a full session note in its **real** date folder — frontmatter (tagged with the transcript's real provider), one iteration block per turn, cost + subagent telemetry, derived decision/bug/learning notes, finalized closing. It is an offline replay of the live capture flow, so an imported note is indistinguishable from a captured one.

```bash
wendkeep import --vault .myproject-vault --dry-run   # preview what would be imported (both agents)
wendkeep import --vault .myproject-vault             # write the notes
wendkeep import --vault .myproject-vault --source codex   # just Codex
```

- **Both agents by default** (`--source all`). Claude sessions come from `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`; Codex rollouts from `~/.codex/sessions/**`, scoped to this project by the `cwd` recorded in each session (case- and separator-insensitive, subdirs included). Narrow with `--source claude` / `--source codex`.
- Every note records its **`session_id`** and **`provider`** in frontmatter (live capture and import alike). Backfill older notes with `wendkeep import --stamp-ids` (fills the id from the registry; idempotent).
- **Deduped** by `session_id` against the vault's `SESSION_REGISTRY` **and** existing notes' frontmatter — only sessions not already present are imported, and it never overwrites an existing note. Re-running is a no-op.
- **`--from <dir>`** / **`--codex-from <dir>`** point at the transcript folders explicitly (use if the auto-derived path misses). Also: `--since <date>`, `--limit <n>`, `--json`.
- Once imported, `wendkeep cost` aggregates your entire history — retroactively, across both agents.

## Change lifecycle — the a2 loop (spec‑driven, native)

Beyond capturing sessions, wendkeep is a **harness**: a native, zero‑dependency loop that keeps *intent* (specs), *work* (changes) and *proof* (sensors) together in the vault, wikilinked into the Obsidian graph.

```
explore → propose → apply (TDD) → verify → archive
```

- **Propose** — `wendkeep change new <slug>` scaffolds `08-Mudanças/<slug>/` (`proposta.md`, `design.md`, `tarefas.md`, and a `specs/` delta). The change becomes *active* and is injected at the next `SessionStart`, so the agent resumes work‑in‑progress.
- **Apply** — implement each `tarefas.md` task. Tag a task that needs machine proof with `[sensor:<id>]`.
- **Verify** — `wendkeep verify` runs the sensors your tasks declared (from `wendkeep.sensors.json` at the project root) and records `evidencia.json`. A critical red fails the gate; a `warning` red is advisory.
- **Archive** — `wendkeep change archive <slug>` **gates** on the evidence (blocks unless every declared critical sensor is green), promotes each capability's spec delta (`ADDED`/`MODIFIED`/`REMOVED`) into the living `07-Specs/<capability>.md`, moves the change to `_arquivo/`, and mints an ADR in `04-Decisões/`.

`wendkeep init` also seeds **native process skills** (`wk-workflow`, `wk-tdd`, `wk-debugging`, `wk-brainstorming`, `wk-planning`, `wk-verify`) into `.brain/skills` and delivers them to `.claude/skills` — the *how* layer, zero‑dep. Optional companions (`context-mode`, `dotcontext`, `understand-anything`, `caveman`) remain an opt‑in extra layer.

### The loop in five minutes

```bash
npx wendkeep init --yes                        # vault + hooks + sensors + skills
npx wendkeep change new dark-mode              # proposta/design/tarefas — change is now active
```

Edit `tarefas.md` — tag proof and requirement per task:

```markdown
- [ ] 1.1 toggle persists across sessions [req:UI-1] [sensor:tests]
```

Declare the capability in `proposta.md` (`specs: [ui]`) and author its delta in
`specs/ui/spec.md` (`## ADDED Requirements` → `### Requisito: UI-1 — dark mode toggle`). Then:

```bash
npx wendkeep change status                     # one screen: tasks / sensors / verdict
npx wendkeep change done 1.1                   # tick a task from the CLI
npx wendkeep verify                            # run the declared sensors -> evidencia.json
npx wendkeep verify --deep                     # assemble the verification package
# the wk-verify skill (fresh, read-only pass) writes verdict.json
npx wendkeep change diff                       # preview what will land in 07-Specs
npx wendkeep change archive dark-mode          # gate: sensors + verdict + no open tasks
```

The archive promotes the delta into the living `07-Specs/ui.md`, mints an ADR, and the
Obsidian graph now links *session ↔ change ↔ requirement ↔ decision*. A change that names
no `[req:]` skips the independent verdict — the sensor gate is its proof.

## How it works

```
agent session ──hooks──▶ wendkeep ──▶ Markdown in vault ──▶ .brain index + Obsidian graph
   (Claude/Codex)        (Node)      (02-Sessões/…)        (CORE+DIGEST, backlinks)
```

The agent's settings.json points each hook at `npx wendkeep hook …`. On `Stop`, wendkeep parses the session transcript, appends the turn, updates the token/cost table, and (idempotently) emits any decision/bug/learning notes. On every `SessionStart`, `brain-inject` injects back the curated memory (CORE + DIGEST), the active change, project lessons, and a `<wk_process>` router that routes any non‑trivial task through the a2 loop (plan → `change new` + fill the scaffold → TDD → verify → archive).

The archive **gate** blocks unless: the change scaffold is filled (G0), no task is open (G1), every declared critical sensor is green (with fresh evidence), and — when the change declares `[req:]` — an independent `verdict.json` covers them. `--force` is the human escape hatch; the agent is instructed never to use it on its own.

## Notes & roadmap

- **Vault folder names default to Portuguese** (`02-Sessões`, `04-Decisões`, …). Pass `wendkeep init --locale en` for an English vault (`02-Sessions`, `04-Decisions`, English scaffold/skills). The locale is a vault property, locked at init; parsers are bilingual so mixed content never breaks.
- **Search is keyword/frontmatter scoring**, not on‑device embeddings (that's on the roadmap).
- **Transcript formats are agent‑internal** and can change between agent versions; parsing is isolated but may need updates.
- Installer wires **Claude Code** settings + `.mcp.json`. Codex hooks run on the same scripts but are not auto‑wired yet (import already covers past Codex sessions via `--source codex`).
